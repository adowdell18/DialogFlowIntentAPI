"Your only as strong as your weakest link, so you need to fix Sgt. Cramer before you're both out of here!",2
"How about you stand at the position of attention when you speak to me, Sergeant. Then why don't you explain to me why you think it's acceptable to try and tarnish your peers reputations with me before I had a chance to make my judgement calls? ",2
"He was enjoying his job, then one of his squad members sabotaged his vehicle.",2
As a platoon leader you are failing your men by not correcting inappropriate behavior.,2
SGT. Johnson but that's information I do not need to know at the moment. fall inline and keep Cramer inline before I do.,2
"SFC Johnson, you whine too much. The platoon seems fine to me. You are in no position to point fingers here, and I can see no sensibility in what you have said. Fortunately, I plan to be a superior platoon leader.",2
SFC Johnson you said your Platoon is good shape but how can it be in good shape if you don't have a full Platoon to train properly.,2
"Sergeant, I sympathize with your situation, but you need to learn to separate your personal and professional lives.",2
"Gossip like this is highly unprofessional. Without having given me the chance to feel out my leadership on my own, you've attempted to influence my opinion of another NCO in our unit. Do no to that again.",2
You are obviously not very good at leading if you keep pulling Cramer to the side and he still keeps getting in trouble. Do not worry I will have a talk with him and he wont get in anymore trouble.,2
"Sgt Cramer, I do not know why you think it is acceptable to treat other members of this platoon the way you do. You need to fix yourself now!",2
"I don't want to hear about SGT Cramer and how he handle his squad, it is your job and responsibility to make sure that all members of your platoon taken care of.",2
Thank you for the information but some of that was unnecessary,2
"I will need to speak with you at length SFC Johnson. There are some obvious issues that need addressed, despite how well you think things are going under your leadership. ",2
Do you think it is professional to gossip to me about other soldiers?,2
Well we are glad to have you! I am glad I made the decision to promote you even though some of your long time friends did not think you were right for the job.,2
Do not talk about your fellow soldiers behind their back like this. This is potential grounds for slander and I don't want to hear about it again.,2
"SFC Johnson it is in within your duties and obligations to control your soldiers, especially your squad leaders. You have failed as a PSGT. I am holding you accountable for SGT Cramer's actions now and in the future. ",2
"SFC Johnson, who do you think you are? Never speak to a superior in such a way. ",2
"SFC Johnson, I think we can get more out of the platoon. I need you to take more responsibility to get the platoon where I want us to be.",2
"SFC Johnson, are you seriously trying to say that drinking and harassment within the platoon can be dealt with using an informal conversation? You know the severity and consequences of these issues, what were you thinking?",2
Why haven't you fixed this already? It reflects poorly on you that this has gone on to this degree.,2
Good job.,2
It sounds like you are not doing enough to help SGT Cramer. If you did more to help him drinking should not be a problem,2
He sounds selfish and rude. Everyone should be working harder. There is no excuse.,2
How many times have you let Sergeant Cramer get away with drinking too much? This could damage the Soldiers faith in their leadership.,2
"Maybe it is you who i causing cramer to have these mood swings, he is drinking because of the disorganization that you are causing here in this PL.",2
You're fired Mate..,2
Looks like you have let some things slip through the cracks that I will have to clean up.,2
"Now that I am PL, this unit will operate 1000% better than you could ever have done.",2
"SFC Johnson, I will not condone talking negatively about your fellow NCOs in that manner.  Speak like that again and you and I are going to have to have a chat about professionalism and respect, understood?",2
"Hey, don't be a buddy fucker, guy. I'll draw my own conclusions about the personnel assigned to me. Get back to work and get out of my face. Guy.",2
Sounds like there are many issues that are unresolved within the Platoon.  I will tackle those thank you.,2
Why did you immediately start chewing out SFC Kramer? Have you ever led before?,2
I'd just keep your opinions to yourself before telling everyone new to the company what wrong has been done to you.,2
Iâ€™m not sure why you are so excited. It sounds like the platoon is meeting the standard and not doing anything beyond the standard.,3
I think you can do more.,3
In the future SFC Johnson you will present me with documentation and a written statement of any issues with soldiers within the platoon before you make accusations without any supportive documentation.,3
Why would you tell me something like that outside of the correct line of communication? We need to establish some professional guidelines immediately.,3
"This is not acceptable.  Fall back, identify problems, and improve.",3
"Thank you for bringing this to my attention but please, lets keep this a professional work environment.  I will take ownership from now on.St",3
Sounds like we have a small issue on our hands with that 2nd Squad Leader. Ill take over from here with him...,3
That is good we are a great platoon but two squads are missing people and a squad leader has a drinking problem.,3
"You clearly haven't solved the problem, you're treating the symptom and not the root issue. I will take care of this.",3
I need to have a talk with Sgt. Cramer. His actions are unacceptable and needs to change.,3
Although you are good I feel like you could be better as acting platoon leader.,3
I think that is a bad idea.,3
I expect you to make arrangements for the transfer of SGT Cramer to another duty assignment.,3
"The next time this happens, I'll write you up. Knock it off. ",3
Why are we so behind in personal rediness as  platoon? I gave you a list of things that needed to get done by this week and you have failed to meet my expectations.,3
Thats not your call to make. Let me form my own opinion.,3
"SFC Johnson, i see that the platoon does well, but if you are able to help your peers you should be able to perform better.",3
"If SGT. Cramer is giving that kind of attitude to others, why hasn't the issue been resolved already? Why now are you bringing it up to me?",3
"While you have been doing a good job, I will need you to take a step back now. Just telling him doesn't sound like it's working.",3
Thank you for your report and the work you have done to better the platoon but I must admit I am largely disappointed in your failure to maintain growth in all aspects of the platoon.,3
"SFC Johnson, as great as this platoon has been performing, the platoon is only as strong as its weakest link, and if that's the case, I'd say you're not doing your full duty as platoon sergeant. SGT Cramer needs to get on line or you will continue to fail",3
If we have known about the missing men in the 3rd and 4th squads why hasn't more been done to fix this issue?,3
"When dealing with issues of harassment, merely pulling someone aside is not enough. You are now liable. ",3
You should do better. Sergent should not be drinking when around his platoon.,3
"SFC Johnson, this is currently not a priority for me. I will handle this issue when I've taken care of other, more important items.",3
that was very unprofessional and i dont appreciate that.,3
"This is a major problem SFC, your soldiers are being harassed by a squad leader on your watch. Don't try to downplay the seriousness of this situation.",3
"Sgt. Cramer, if you want to remain a member of this platoon, you need to straighten up your actions before it is to late.",3
Thank you for telling me your opinion about Sgt Cramer but I'd like to see his actions before I just to any conclusions.,3
"Sgt. Johnson, I trust that you know we have a zero-tolerance harassment policy here. Handle it before I get involved.",3
"Sergeant, SGT Cramer's attitude is unacceptable. I will need you to step down immediately so we can get this PLT back in order.",3
I am disappointed to hear that these problems with Sgt. Cramer have gone on for so long. We may have to take more serious action to correct his behavior.,3
Is chewing SFC Kramer out the most productive way to help him?,3
"SFC, I'm disappointed to hear you have a PLT with leadership like Cramer.",3
"SFC Johnson, do you think this platoon is in a good shape? Are you out of your mind? Wake up and get your shit done so I can actually do something with these people who call themselves soldiers pathetically.",3
We have a squad leader that has a drinking problem? Please elaborate.,3
"Easy there, Sergeant. Lets slow down and take things step by step and do this by the book.",3
"How could you have so much pride and you've failed your platoon. If a Squad leader is failing, so have you.",3
That is probably not the best way to be handling the situation. You should be reprimanded.,3
"Its good to hear your side of the story about this platoon, but I have heard otherwise. This platoon still needs a lot of work when it comes to getting things done in a more efficient way. We will take care of this together.",3
"SFC Johnson, We have no more men to replace the one man short squads. We are already down men as it is and cannot get them from anywhere else.",3
Our team is only as strong as our weakest link. Start counseling Sgt Kramer about his drinking and job performance.,3
"SFC Johnson we will improve the readiness of the platoon to include habits detrimental towards readiness, such as alcohol. ",4
Good to hear that the platoon is so strong.,4
"Don't worry about your ERB, SFC Johnson. So long as you are doing what you are supposed to be doing and getting the job done, your ERB will take care of itself. As far as I'm concerned, you're doing great. ",4
I am sorry that you have had to deal with this for so long. I will take it upon myself to speak with Cramer in order to resolve your current predicament Sergeant.,4
"SFC Johnson, I am excited to have the opportunity to be apart of this platoon. We will talk soon about ways we can improve the weak links in the platoon.",4
"Every company does tend to have a few problematic personnel, so thanks for looking out for your soldiers. Now that I'm here, I can keep an eye on SGT Cramer.",4
We will try to work out a plan to solve this issue together.,4
"SFC Johnson, you have done your best to keep the platoon together.",4
"SFC Johnson, you've done an excellent job bringing this to my attention. I will introduce myself to Cramer and find out if he has an underlying reason for drinking.",4
"I got it from here, Sergeant. I will make sure you are recognized later for your work but you can relax now and go back to your role as PSG.",4
SFC I appreciate everything you doing for you are an outstanding leader but I will have to speak to SRG Cramer personally to figure out what is exactly going on.,4
We are glad you are here just remember that excitement is good but sometimes its good not to show it to gain respect from the others.,4
Tell me about the good that the squad leaders and team leaders are doing.,4
"SFC Johnson, I do not worry about Sgt. Cramer since you seem to be able to standardize him as you have assured me. Keep your good work and let me know if you have any problem with him. ",4
"Sgt. Cramer, understand that the topic of your harassment has upon other Squad leaders has came up. Do not be worried, I am here to talk about how we can fix this.",4
Thanks for the heads up SFC.,4
"SFC Cramer, you've done a great job getting me up to speed on the company, thank you. That being said, please remember to maintain professionalism in regards to your peers weaknesses. I'll keep an eye out for his drinking problems and harassment.",4
"SFC Johnson, I do not plan on changing too much of what you have already started due to the high progress the platoon has already made. ",4
"Sgt. Cramer, I would like to talk to you personally about what is going on with you interactions with the other squads.",4
"Good job looking out for your soldiers! It's good to know this company has some good men willing to go beyond their duties. I'll be able to handle discipline from here on, however.",4
"SFC Johnson, I'm grateful for your forthright and constructive feedback, I am sure it will be useful in crafting our roadmap for the platoon. ",4
"I know this is a lot of responsibility to take on, but we will be assigning you an assistant to help you delegate and most efficiently spend your time.",4
"I see that there are some issues within that we may have to take care of, thank you.",4
