Let's talk about how we can improve the squad leader's disposition permanently. I want to hear what you think is the best plan of action.,1
"I has been excellent work you have done here, Sergeant, and I know you will continue to perform while I am acclimating to this new unit.",1
Let's keep it up! Introduce me to the other squad leaders!,1
We are excited to have a new face in our division!!,1
Thank you for the heads up. we will monitor the drinking from cramer but other than that im excited to get this thing rolling.,1
"You have been performing really well, here is a 3 day pass for the weekend.",1
I am looking forward to continuing the success of this platoon by working together.,1
"Hooah! Great job staying on top of things, let's keep this platoon working well!",1
"Thank you for you work as acting PL, Sergeant. I will be relying on you for the next few days while I get my bearings in this new unit.",1
The amazing leadership you have demonstrated deserves to be recognized by not only myself but also by the platoon as a whole. Thank you!,1
Is there anyone else that is having issues in the platoon that I should know about.,1
"I am thrilled to hear that the soldiers are so well disciplined, it sounds like we will have a great platoon!",1
I can tell that you are a hard worker.  Once I become accommodated to the unit we will have a look at your career path and see what we need to do to get you to the next level.,1
"SFC Johnson, All of our men are trained to the best of their abilities and will serve as needed. We have you to thank for the outstanding situations and drills you have given them in order to be prepared.",1
That is great news the way that you are handling the SFC. Let me buy you a beer because of the exceptional way that you handled the situation.,1
It seems like all the great things I've heard are true. Thanks for doing a great job. Our platoon is lucky to have you.,1
Excellent job Sgt.,1
"I love the motivation but, be careful of that last comment. You know how things are. Definitely let me know the next time something is up. ",1
Decide to use same energy in response back to SFC to show confidence in his choice and that you are supporting him. Create a way that makes task of maintaining/improving unit a priority under his guidance to see how he responds,1
"SFC Johnson, if this is how you are everyday the platoon will be better each day with you in charge of it.",1
Good work SFC Johnson.,1
It is good to see you taking charge of the situation Sergeant. I am certain that you will make a good CO one day.,1
Awesome job SFC Johnson cant wait to keep up the great work with you.,1
I can see that you have done great work with these squads and I am honored to be working with you sir!,1
"Tomorrow Johnson, you are leading the squad to victory!!",1
Keep up the good work. Any platoon would be happy to have you.,1
"SFC Johnson, youâ€™re a beast; not only have I heard that you were a great platoon leader without any officer training, something that I had to go to school for, but, you were also able to keep the platoon in great shape. That is IMPRESSIVE!!",1
Good work on being so on top of your platoon. I want updates on the squad leader's progress and any other issues.,1
Elated about the good news,1
That's excellent to hear. I am excited to be working with such a high-functioning team.,1
All right good work! Lets keep it up and make sure this Platoon maintains high readiness.,1
That is such great news! I am thoroughly impressed with your accomplishments!,1
"Thank you for you work as acting PL, Sergeant. I will be relying on you for the next few days while I get my bearings in this new unit.",1
"I'm glad to know that you are also excited to start working and increase how well the platoon works, and we will make sure they are the best platoon in the battalion.",1
"SFJ Johnson, our platoon is only as strong as a weakest link. However, by working in cohesion, no matter the problems that may arise, we will make sure this platoon continues to exceed its great performance. ",1
"""You inform him that you've heard about the outstanding work he has done as Acting Platoon Leader and express your excitement""",1
Great! Keep it up.,1
"SFC Johnson, you really know your soldiers and I would love to continue the good work and strive to make this platoon the best that it can be!",1
"Well, I guess theres no problem with a little drinking now and then, as long as the work gets done and you keep him in check.",1
I am glad you brought this to my attention once you did. Things could've gotten a lot worse. I am proud of you Sergeant.,1
Thank you for informing me of these issues! Drinking could definitely be an issue in the future so I will pay close attention to Cramer!,1
Great work as acting platoon leader!,1
If you know he is doing such a bad job then why haven't you already solved the issue prior to my arrival here?,2
"Thank you, SFC Johnson. I am can see the hard work you have put into this platoon. Do not stress about SGT Cramer, we can both work with him to better the platoon. ",2
SFC Kramer's lack of discipline is a representation of the leadership he's getting from his own leaders. That means you!,2
What possessed you come to me with this gossip.  If there is a problem I suggest you come up with a way to correct it.,2
"SFC Johnson, why was this not brought to my attention sooner? SGT Cramer showing up smelling like alcohol and yelling at people are not okay in this platoon. If it keeps happening there will be consequences for both him and yourself. ",2
"SFC Johnson, your criticisms are absolutely ludicrous! You are far too quick to wag your tongue but painfully slow to act on anything. It seems to me that you are a man of far too many words and few too many actions.",2
"SFC, how about you let me make my own judgments about MY platoon members.",2
